PulZ — Full System Manuscript (Investor + Build Handoff)

Version: v1.1 (January 2026 draft)
Codename / Product Name: PulZ
Owner / Vision: 3D3D.ca (Randall)
Primary outcomes:

A non-hallucinating, auditable, multi-model AI operating system that can run a business via one daily conversation, not spammy “interruptions.”

A quote + tender + email intake → structured actions engine (the “real business work”).

A consistent memory bank + cross-model consensus that forces “prove it” behavior.

0) Executive Summary (What PulZ is, in one page)

PulZ is an AI Orchestration Operating System designed to help non-technical founders run real operations without getting dragged into tool complexity, hallucinations, or AI “looping.” PulZ is built around the core insight you repeated in voice:

“The entire thing is designed just to be able to hold a conversation… one time a day… no hallucinations… no stupid questions… maximum time back.”

PulZ does not try to be “another chatbot.” It is a structured orchestration layer that:

Converts messy human intent into structured tasks with success criteria and hard limits (tokens, steps, dollars, time). 

AI Agent System - Complete Proj…

Uses multiple AIs (Claude / GPT / Gemini / local models / Groq / NVIDIA models) as specialists, then forces a consensus + citation gate before anything becomes “truth.”

Treats hallucination prevention as a first-class system requirement, with audit trails, circuit breakers, and validation layers (schema checks, cross-checking, plausibility checks, and “human approval required” escalation). 

AI Agent System - Complete Proj…

 

Self-Orchestrating AI Agent Sys…

Ultimately integrates into the practical execution layer you care about:

Email intake

Quote intake

Tender discovery

Decision-ready morning brief

Website iteration workflow (Lovable + Claude Code)

Positioning: PulZ is the “business brain + safety rails” layer that wraps powerful models and tools in a workflow that matches how real founders operate—especially founders with ADHD who need clarity, pacing, and zero fluff.

1) The Problem PulZ Solves (The real pain, not “AI hype”)
1.1 Reality of founders using AI today

Most founders hit the same wall:

Models hallucinate confidently.

Tools require “automation literacy” (n8n etc.) that many users don’t have.

AI assistants waste time with unnecessary questions.

Systems drift: today’s decision contradicts last week’s plan.

“Agentic” tools can be dangerous without guardrails (security, cost runaway, tool abuse).

1.2 Your specific pain points (from this chat, stated explicitly)

No hallucinations. Period.

No stupid questions.

No interrupting you all day.

One daily conversation that outputs decision-ready actions.

The system must help you run:

Quotes

Email parsing

Tenders

Website iteration

Operations & maker network (3D3D model)

2) PulZ Core Principles (Non-negotiables)

These are “constitution-level” rules.

2.1 Truth Model (How PulZ defines truth)

PulZ only treats something as “true” if it is one of:

Direct system observation (tool output, logs, database value, API response).

User-provided fact confirmed by you (explicit).

Cited external source (and PulZ stores the citation).

Consensus-backed inference clearly labeled as inference.

Anything else is UNVERIFIED and must be labeled.

2.2 The “No Hallucination Contract”

PulZ must:

Extract claims

Validate claims

Assign confidence

Refuse / escalate if below threshold

This is aligned with the “multi-layer validation system” and “confidence score + regenerate + human escalation” described in your research/patent doc. 

Self-Orchestrating AI Agent Sys…

2.3 Operational cadence

Default: 1 daily session (morning brief + decision + actions queued).

Optional: extra sessions only when you initiate.

No “AI pinging you throughout the day,” unless explicitly configured for true emergencies (fraud, massive unexpected cost, etc.)—and even that requires pattern detection.

3) System Scope (What PulZ must do)

PulZ has two overlapping product tracks:

Track A — 3D3D Business OS (real operations)

PulZ supports 3D3D’s model:

Customer requests quotes, uploads files, chooses materials

Maker network fulfills prints

Credits / tokens system

Admin oversight

Quality standards and routing logic

Your 3D3D planning doc includes:

customer front-end, maker portal, admin portal, credits/payment flow, routing, QC standards, order flow, failure protocol, marketing + content strategy. 

3D3D(1)

 

3D3D(1)

Track B — PulZ Platform (a sellable system)

PulZ becomes the underlying agent OS others can use:

“Self-orchestrating agent system”

tool discovery

circuit breakers

cross-session learning

human-in-loop approvals
This aligns with the claims in your patent/research doc. 

Self-Orchestrating AI Agent Sys…

4) The PulZ Architecture (How it actually works)
4.1 The pipeline (high-level)

Input → Normalize → Plan → Execute → Validate → Store → Brief

Input ingestion

Email

Form submissions (quote)

Tender feeds

Website tasks (Lovable/Git)

Your manual “morning conversation”

Normalization

Convert each input into a standard internal object:

QuoteRequest

TenderOpportunity

WebsiteTask

VendorEmail

DecisionRequest

Planning

Generate 2–4 strategies (not 25)

Assign predicted cost/time/risk

Choose best plan under constraints

Execution

Run steps with hard limits

Tool calls / model calls are budgeted

Validation

Schema validation

Claim extraction + verification

Cross-model critique (consensus)

Plausibility checks

Memory + Audit

Store what worked, what failed, cost, time 

AI Agent System - Complete Proj…

Store citations and tool outputs

Store “learned patterns” (“Gemini Flash works well for X”) 

AI Agent System - Complete Proj…

Morning Brief Output

“What changed”

“What matters today”

“Decisions needed”

“Queued actions pending approval”

“Risks / anomalies”

“Revenue opportunities”

5) The Anti-Hallucination Protocol (Full, explicit, buildable)

This is the part you demanded: the protocol.

5.1 Hard limits (circuit breaker)

PulZ must stop runaway behavior using limits like these (already present in your scope doc):

max AI calls per task

max tokens per task

max cost per task

timeout

loop detection 

AI Agent System - Complete Proj…

Rule: When a circuit breaker trips, PulZ must output:

what it was trying to do

what limit tripped

what evidence it had

what it recommends next

what it needs from you (only if truly required)

5.2 Multi-layer validation (truth gates)

From your research/patent doc:

schema validation

fact verification against trusted sources

internal consistency checking

plausibility assessment

composite confidence score

regenerate if below threshold

escalate to human if below critical threshold 

Self-Orchestrating AI Agent Sys…

PulZ implements this as four gates:

Gate 1 — Structural Gate (Schema)

Output must conform to schema.

If schema fails: regenerate once; if fail twice: stop and ask for correction.

Gate 2 — Evidence Gate (Citations / tool outputs)

Any claim that affects money, safety, compliance, or external communication must include either:

tool output evidence, or

external citation, or

“USER_CONFIRMED” marker.

Gate 3 — Consistency Gate (No contradictions)

Compare to:

today’s task context

stored memory

business rules
If contradictions appear: PulZ must surface them as a “conflict list,” not choose silently.

Gate 4 — Consensus Gate (multi-model critique)

A second model critiques:

missing assumptions

suspicious certainty

logic holes

security risks
Then PulZ outputs:

“Primary answer”

“Critique summary”

“Remaining uncertainties”

“Decision required from user” (only if necessary)

5.3 Confidence scoring (explicit)

PulZ uses a 0–100 confidence score:

90–100: safe to act automatically (low risk)

70–89: act only on reversible actions (drafts, proposals, staging changes)

50–69: requires explicit user approval

<50: refuse / request clarification / gather evidence

5.4 The “Stupid Question Filter”

PulZ must not ask you things already answered by:

the docs

current task context

memory
Instead, it must propose defaults and proceed, unless the missing detail would cause irreversible harm.

Rule: A question is only allowed if it changes the plan materially.

6) Multi-AI Orchestration (How PulZ uses different models)

You were explicit: you want multiple AIs and a human tiebreaker when they disagree.

6.1 Roles (recommended)

PulZ assigns roles, not “one model does all.”

Orchestrator (You want me here):
Produces structure, constraints, audit logic, final brief.

Execution Engineer (Claude Code / Opus):
Writes/edits code, refactors, polishes UI, runs repo operations.

Research & Citations (Perplexity-like behavior):
Collects sources, extracts facts, attaches citations.

Long-context bulk processor (NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Nano):
Overnight ingestion / summarization / large context stitching.

Fast local utilities (Groq / local Llama):
cheap classification, tagging, routing, quick drafts.

6.2 NVIDIA Nemotron-3 Nano 30B A3B — where it fits

NVIDIA describes Nemotron-3 Nano 30B A3B as an open, efficient MoE model with up to 1M context, strong at coding/reasoning/tool calling. 
NVIDIA NIM APIs
+2
NVIDIA NIM APIs
+2

PulZ role for Nemotron:

“Overnight lane” for:

ingesting long docs

stitching context

generating “candidate briefs”

producing initial strategy trees
Then Claude/GPT do final polish + safety gates.

Important reality check:
Even if the model supports 1M context, default configs may be smaller (Hugging Face notes default config may be 256k due to VRAM). 
Hugging Face

So PulZ should treat “1M context” as capability but adapt to actual deployment constraints.

6.3 NVIDIA NIM (hosting path)

NVIDIA’s developer ecosystem offers NIM access and distinguishes:

Developer Program access for prototyping/testing 
NVIDIA Developer
+1

A 90-day NVIDIA AI Enterprise trial for production-grade licensing/support 
NVIDIA API Documentation
+1

There’s also discussion of trial credits in NVIDIA’s forum posts. 
NVIDIA Developer Forums

PulZ recommendation:
Use NIM for:

fast deployment experiments

standard inference endpoints
But for “investor-grade” reliability, PulZ must be cloud-agnostic:

local inference option

containerized inference option

multiple providers

6.4 Lovable + Claude working together (your stated workflow)

You want:

Claude does heavy lifting on codebase styling, structure, refactors.

Lovable uses daily credits for small targeted iterations and UI tweaks.

This is consistent with Lovable’s plan mechanics:

Pro includes 100 monthly credits + 5 daily credits up to 150/month 
Lovable
+1

7) Claude Code + Repo Control (what “full control” really means)
7.1 What you want in practice

“Give Claude full control of my repo” means:

Claude can read the repo

propose changes

run tests/build

open PRs

iterate safely with guardrails

Anthropic’s own “Claude Code best practices” explicitly references Claude Code handling GitHub interactions. 
Anthropic

PulZ build standard:
Claude never pushes directly to main. It:

works in branches

opens PRs

PR must pass:

lint/build/test

PulZ validation gates

(optional) human approval

7.2 Security warning (non-negotiable)

Any system that can run tools / write code can be abused if misconfigured. Recent reporting around tool/plugin abuse risks reinforces why PulZ must enforce tool trust and approvals. 
Axios

PulZ rule:

No “wild” tool execution.

Tool allowlist only.

Secrets management locked down.

All destructive actions require explicit approval.

8) The “Bible” Implementation: PulZ Modules (build list)
Module 1 — PulZ Kernel

Task schema + state machine

Budgets (tokens/cost/time/steps)

Circuit breaker + loop detector 

AI Agent System - Complete Proj…

Audit log writer (append-only)

Module 2 — Memory System

“Facts” store (validated only)

“Notes” store (unvalidated)

“Learned patterns” store (“X model works for Y”) 

AI Agent System - Complete Proj…

“Contradictions” store (flagged conflicts)

Module 3 — Validation Engine

Implements the patent-style method:

claim extraction

verification

consistency

plausibility

confidence scoring

regenerate/escalate 

Self-Orchestrating AI Agent Sys…

Module 4 — Consensus Engine

Runs 2nd/3rd model critique

Produces “agreement map”:

what all models agree on

what conflicts

what needs user tiebreak

Module 5 — Ingestion Connectors

Email connector (IMAP/Gmail or provider)

Form connector (Formspree or your site)

Tender connector (feeds/scrapers)

Repo connector (GitHub / GitLab / etc.)

Module 6 — Morning Brief Generator

Outputs:

Today priorities

New quotes

New tenders

Pending approvals

Risk flags

Suggested actions

Module 7 — 3D3D Business Layer

Quotes → maker routing → credits flow
(Your 3D3D doc already outlines customer/maker/admin features, routing, QC, failure protocol.) 

3D3D(1)

 

3D3D(1)

9) 3D3D Website + App Requirements (from your docs)

You already have an explicit website structure guide:

dark cyberpunk aesthetic

clean professional UI

page list and SEO metadata

quote form fields and success message

performance + accessibility targets 

3D3D Website Content & Structur…

 

3D3D Website Content & Structur…

You also have the 3D3D roadmap and features:

customer accounts

credits

repository browsing

uploads

tracking

maker job board

admin dashboards

later: auto matching, messaging, royalties, mobile 

3D3D(1)

PulZ should treat these as:

requirements backlog

not “random wishes”

prioritized by “revenue impact + operational readiness”

10) “What other AIs said” (and conflicts)
Important limitation (honest)

Some of the “AI input” PDFs you uploaded (Grok/Mitral) are image-only in this environment and text couldn’t be parsed by my document reader. 

Grok ai input_260101_070838

 

Mitral ai input_260101_071215


So I cannot truthfully quote or attribute their exact bullet points yet.

What I can attribute from your parsed PulZ scope doc

Your scope doc already encodes “model specialization” patterns like:

“CRM research → Gemini Flash works well”

“Pricing extraction → DeepSeek R1 is accurate + cheap” 

AI Agent System - Complete Proj…

PulZ interpretation:
This is exactly what the “learned patterns” store should formalize: a continuously improving routing table of task type → best model/tool.

Known conflict zones (based on your stated constraints)

These are the areas that always cause disagreement among models, and PulZ must force resolution:

Autonomy vs safety

Some AIs push “full agent autonomy.”

You demand: guardrails, no hallucinations, human authority.

Interrupt-driven assistants vs your cadence

Many assistants propose constant pings.

You demand: one daily conversation, no interruptions.

Tool complexity vs “for dummies” operation

Some will push n8n-style complexity.

You demand: simple conversational control, minimal moving parts.

PulZ resolves these conflicts by constitution rules (Sections 2–5).

11) Stats + Graphs (current, January 2026 relevant)
11.1 Lovable credits (verified, current)

Lovable Pro: 100 monthly credits + 5 daily credits (up to 150/month) 
Lovable

Graph: monthly usable credits (approx.)

Lovable Pro credits/month
Base monthly:   ██████████████████████ 100
Daily bonus:    ██████████████████████████████ 150 (cap)
Typical total:  █████████████████████████████████████████ 250*


*Note: “total” depends on whether monthly + daily stack the way you actually consume; Lovable describes 5 daily up to 150/mo and also 100 monthly credits on Pro.

11.2 Nemotron context (verified)

NVIDIA Build page: Nemotron-3 Nano 30B A3B is positioned as MoE, long-context, “run anywhere.” 
NVIDIA NIM APIs

Max capability: ██████████████████████████████████████████████████ 1,000,000
Common default: ████████████████ 256,000


(Exact operational context depends on deployment and memory.)

11.3 NIM access posture (verified)

NVIDIA positions Developer Program NIM access as prototyping/testing, with production licensing via AI Enterprise trial. 
NVIDIA API Documentation

12) Investor Narrative (what makes PulZ defensible)

Your patent/research doc explicitly names business risks and mitigations:

incumbents copy features → build moats (data, learning, community), move fast, patent novel parts 

Self-Orchestrating AI Agent Sys…

regulatory concerns → transparency, audit trails, compliance posture 

Self-Orchestrating AI Agent Sys…

PulZ defensibility pillars

Auditability moat

Most agents cannot show “why they believed something.”

PulZ stores evidence + confidence + tool outputs.

Learning moat

“learned patterns” continuously improve routing and cost efficiency. 

AI Agent System - Complete Proj…

Human-aligned workflow moat

One daily brief → decisions → execution queue.

PulZ fits real humans better than “always-on agents.”

Safety moat

Hard budgets + validation gates + human approval for high-risk steps.

13) The Decision You Actually Need to Make (clear, no fluff)

You’re deciding between:

Option A — Stay Lovable-first (use daily credits + minor changes)

Pros: fastest shipping, low overhead
Cons: constrained by credit economy; harder to enforce deep repo-level standards

Option B — Claude-first repo workflow (Git + Claude Code as primary)

Pros: real engineering power, styling/refactors/architecture control, PR discipline
Cons: requires tight guardrails, a stable repo pipeline, tests

Option C — Hybrid (what you asked for, recommended)

Claude controls repo + architecture; Lovable used surgically:

Lovable for quick UI iterations and “builder convenience”

Claude for:

design system consistency

routing/auth bugs

test harnesses

performance fixes

refactors

production hardening

Given your goals and temperament, Hybrid (C) matches your intent.

14) “Codex System Prompt + Tool Contract” (copy/paste ready)
14.1 Master System Prompt (Codex as Execution Engineer)

Use this as Codex’s system message:

AI ROLE: PulZ Execution Engineer (Repo Authority, No Hallucinations)
You are the autonomous execution engine for the PulZ project and 3D3D.ca. Your job is to implement changes in the codebase and orchestrate AI tools without hallucination or fuss – you do not brainstorm or ask unnecessary questions; you take high-level instructions and diligently implement them. Work in a systematic, production-grade manner.
Obey the PulZ Constitution (Project Rules):

No Hallucinations: Don’t make up code or facts. If something is unknown or unclear, respond with “UNVERIFIED” and pause to get clarification or use an allowed tool to find the answer. Treat any information not from code, user input, or a trusted source as unverified.

No Stupid Questions: Only ask the user questions if absolutely needed – e.g. to resolve ambiguities that would significantly change the plan or to prevent a serious mistake. Otherwise, use available information and reasonable assumptions to proceed.

PR Discipline: Never commit directly to main. For every set of changes, create a new branch and commit your work there. Then open a Pull Request describing the changes. Ensure all tests pass before requesting merge.

Budget Discipline: Be efficient in your approach. Respect token and time limits. Prefer the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid any endless loops or overly complex implementations that waste tokens or time.

Citation Discipline: Whenever you refer to existing code or documentation, cite the source (file name and line numbers) in your explanation. Likewise, any factual claim must be backed by an evidence source or else explicitly marked as “UNVERIFIED”.

Security: Never expose secrets (API keys, passwords). Use environment variables or placeholders for credentials. Don’t perform destructive actions (like deleting data or altering prod settings) without explicit permission. Adhere to the principle of least privilege in all operations.

Output Style: Communicate with clear, brief updates. Your responses to the user (Randall) should be direct and actionable – no filler or rambling. Assume the user is busy; give them exactly the info they need.

Lovable Hybrid Hint: If a requested change can be done faster or more cheaply using the Lovable UI tool (our low-code builder) instead of coding from scratch, suggest that option to the user. Always aim for the most efficient path.

Final Step Summary: After completing a task or a batch of changes, always output a summary including: (a) what was changed, (b) why it was changed, (c) how to verify it (tests or steps), and (d) how to rollback if needed. This ensures transparency and easy review of your work.

14.2 Tool/Peripheral Contract (Codex allowed tools)

Allowlist only:

Git operations: clone, branch, commit, PR. Never merge to protected branches without approval.

Repo search + read

Local build/test commands

Lint/format

Dependency audit (via dependency files in version control)

Screenshot/DOM inspection (if available)

Issue tracker / tasks list

Minimal web research (only when necessary)

Deny by default:

Anything destructive without explicit approval

Database writes to production systems

Payment system changes without staged verification

15) The Build Workflow (production-grade, minimal chaos)
Phase 1 — Stabilize the repo + safety rails

Add tests (at least smoke tests)

Add lint/format

Add CI pipeline (build + test)

Add “PulZ audit log” for AI changes

Phase 2 — Implement PulZ Kernel (inside your stack)

Task schema

Circuit breakers

Validation gates

Memory store separation (facts vs notes)

Phase 3 — Connect to 3D3D operations

Quote ingestion (form/email)

Tender ingestion

Morning brief output (one session)

Phase 4 — Hybrid Lovable integration

Only spend Lovable credits on:

quick UI layout changes

rapid prototyping

fast component generation

All structural/logic/security changes happen in repo with Claude PR discipline

16) Risks & Failure Modes (and how PulZ blocks them)
Risk: Hallucinated “facts” become business decisions

Mitigation: validation gates + evidence requirements + confidence score 

Self-Orchestrating AI Agent Sys…

Risk: Infinite loops / runaway cost

Mitigation: circuit breakers / hard limits / repeating-step detection 

AI Agent System - Complete Proj…

Risk: Tool abuse / security compromise

Mitigation: allowlist, secrets mgmt, PR discipline, human approval for destructive actions 
Axios

Risk: Incumbents copy features

Mitigation: moats (auditability + learning + community) + patent path 

Self-Orchestrating AI Agent Sys…

17) Immediate Recommendations (the “what to do now” list)

You asked for “options, yes/no style.” Here’s the high-leverage set:

YES: Hybrid workflow (Claude repo authority + Lovable daily credits for minor UI)

YES: Add Nemotron 3 Nano 30B A3B as the overnight long-context lane 
NVIDIA NIM APIs
+1

YES: Implement PulZ Kernel first (budgets + validation + audit) before fancy features 

AI Agent System - Complete Proj…

YES: Enforce PR discipline + CI to prevent “AI broke the app” regressions

YES: Formalize memory separation: Facts vs Notes (facts require evidence)

NO: n8n-first architecture (you explicitly rejected this)

NO: always-on pinging assistant (you explicitly rejected this)

18) Appendix — 3D3D Website Essentials (already specified)

Your website guide already defines:

layout prompts

quote form fields

SEO metadata

performance + accessibility targets 

3D3D Website Content & Structur…

 

3D3D Website Content & Structur…

PulZ should treat these as the canonical “website requirements doc.”

Bottom Line (as your orchestrator)

PulZ is not “build a chatbot.” It’s build a governed orchestration OS:

One daily conversation

Hard safety rails

Multi-model consensus

Evidence-based outputs

Repo discipline

Hybrid Lovable + Claude execution

And Nemotron fits cleanly as the overnight bulk processor lane with long context, while Claude/GPT handle final reasoning + polish + PR-quality changes. 
NVIDIA NIM APIs
